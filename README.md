#Smart Brain: Face Recognition Project

Welcome to the Smart Brain project repository! This project utilizes React, JavaScript, CSS, Tachyons, and React Particle.js libraries to implement a sophisticated face recognition system. Below, you'll find all the necessary information to understand, set up, and use this system effectively.
Overview

The Smart Brain project employs cutting-edge technologies to recognize faces in images. It utilizes React for building the user interface, JavaScript for logic implementation, CSS for styling, Tachyons for CSS utility classes, and React Particle.js for interactive visual effects.

    Access the Application: Once the development server is running, access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

Once you have the application running, you can use the Smart Brain system as follows:

    Upload Image: Upload an image containing faces using the provided interface.

    Face Detection: The system will automatically detect faces within the uploaded image.

    Face Recognition: Utilizing the trained models, the system will recognize the faces present in the image.

    Output: The system will display the uploaded image with bounding boxes around detected faces and labels indicating recognized faces.

Example

The usage of the Smart Brain system is entirely user-driven through the web interface. Simply follow the instructions provided on the application's homepage to upload an image and observe the face detection and recognition process.
