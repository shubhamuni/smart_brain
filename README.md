Smart Brain: Face Recognition Project

Welcome to the Smart Brain project repository! This project is aimed at implementing a face recognition system using cutting-edge technologies. Below, you will find all the necessary information to understand, set up, and use this system effectively.
Overview

The Smart Brain project utilizes advanced facial recognition algorithms to identify faces in images. It employs deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in recognizing faces within a given dataset.
Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Brain project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bash

    git clone <repository_link>

    Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Refer to the requirements.txt file for details.

    Set Up the Environment: Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to set up the environment correctly.

    Download Pre-trained Models: Download any pre-trained models required for face detection and recognition.

Usage

Once you have set up the environment and installed the dependencies, you can use the Smart Brain system as follows:

    Input Image: Provide an image containing faces as input to the system.

    Face Detection: The system will automatically detect faces within the input image.

    Face Recognition: Utilizing the trained models, the system will recognize the faces present in the image.

    Output: The system will generate an output indicating the recognized faces along with any relevant information.

Example

python

from smart_brain import FaceRecognition

# Initialize the face recognition system
face_recognizer = FaceRecognition()

# Load input image
input_image = "path/to/input/image.jpg"

# Recognize faces
recognized_faces = face_recognizer.recognize_faces(input_image)

# Display results
for face in recognized_faces:
    print(f"Name: {face['name']}, Confidence: {face['confidence']}")
